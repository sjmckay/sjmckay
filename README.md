## Hi! I'm Stephen. 

### I enjoy coding a lot&mdash;both as a part of my PhD research and for side projects I'm interested in.

For my research, I study some of the **dustiest, most distant galaxies** in the Universe. Most of my projects have to do with modeling these galaxies, measuring their brightnesses in images, and doing statistical data analysis on them. I mainly work in Python but enjoy learning new skills and languages (e.g., currently fiddling around with Julia).

Complementary to my research, I am interested in learning and applying machine learning and data science techniques, so I try to always have a side project I'm working on that teaches me a new skill. Lately I have been working on building some PyTorch models for classification and inference tasks.

### Featured package: [mbb](https://github.com/sjmckay/mbb)

I made this package as a quick way to fit **modified blackbody (MBB) models** to a dusty galaxy's spectral energy distribution (SED). Documentation available at [Read the Docs](https://mbb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The code can be used as a simple SED model or to fit photometric data and perform Bayesian parameter estimation. Uncertainties and upper limits are properly accounted for, and the code allows easy access to useful posterior metrics.

You can install mbb using `pip`... if you find it helpful, I'd love to know!
