### Hi! I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

I currently study some of the dustiest, most distant galaxies in the Universe. Most of my coding has to do with modeling these galaxies, measuring their brightnesses in images, and doing statistical data analysis on them. I mainly work in Python but enjoy learning new skills and languages (currently fiddling around with R and Julia, some web design, and machine learning techniques).

### Featured repo [mbb](https://github.com/sjmckay/mbb)

I made this package as a quick way to fit modified blackbody models to a dusty galaxy's spectral energy distribution. You can install it using `pip`... if you find it helpful, I'd love to know!
