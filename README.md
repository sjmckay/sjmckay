### Hi! I'm a Physics PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

I currently study some of the <h style='color:red'> <strong> dustiest, most distant galaxies </strong></h> in the Universe. Most of my coding has to do with modeling these galaxies, measuring their brightnesses in images, and doing statistical data analysis on them. I mainly work in Python but enjoy learning new skills and languages (currently fiddling around with R and Julia, some web design, and machine learning techniques).

### Featured package: [mbb](https://github.com/sjmckay/mbb)

I made this package as a quick way to fit modified blackbody (MBB) models to a dusty galaxy's spectral energy distribution. You can install it using `pip`... if you find it helpful, I'd love to know!
